#STEPHEN BUCHANAN

####As this is my name, it demands to be in the largest of letters

##Quirks
<ul>
	<li>I crack my jaw and/or my right wrist when I get nervous or I'm focusing</li>
	<li>I keep all items in the same pockets no matter what</li>
	<li>I make more jokes and I'm generally more loud, jovial, and boisterous with people I don't know. This allows me to get to know people without exposing my actual personality or exposing vulnerability</li>
</ul>
