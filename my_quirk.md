My quirk? I have way too many to count but I'm narrowing it to five: 
1: I sometimes forget to eat but when I do eat, I have specific OCD ways of eating everything. 
2: I'm extremely clumsy and have tripped over/run into/fallen off of pretty much anything.
3: I can barely touch my toes but the rest of me is extremely flexible. I've been known to fall asleep in certain yoga positions without any discomfort and I dont do yoga regularly.
4: I've never had normal nails because I pick them as a nervous habit and then I pick at the imperfections. It's a vicious cycle I need to break.
5: My favorite band is Coheed and Cambria, where the two main symbols are an esoteric symbol called the 'keywork' and the other is a dragonfly which makes me pleased that I am apart of the Dragonfly cohort. I also can't listen to the band without singing with it.
I've even read and own all the Coheed and Cambria comics (Amory Wars) but my boyfriend has them at the moment.
