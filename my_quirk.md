## My Quirks

####When I play tennis now, I play with a left handed forehand and a right handed forehand. 2 forehands, no backhands! It's pretty awesome. Also, I don't hold chopsticks normally. I put my middle finger in between the chopsticks and I eat like that. I always get weird looks from people, but it works so much better for me. My fingers get sore using the other method and I can pick up way more stuff with my method. My favorite type of workout now is sprint walking. Basically, I wander around for a little bit, then sprint randomly for about 100 yards. It must look really weird, but I like it so much more than jogging. I transferred from Redlands to Madison Wisconsin, then went back to Redlands, then dropped out of college for a semester to work, then went back to Redlands, and I just graduated this fall. And that about does it for my quirkiness. There is definitely more, but thats good for now.
