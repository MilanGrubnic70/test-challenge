#### Background

* After 2 years working with investors and startups in Melbourne, I wanted to build something of my own. 

* I am a SoCal boy, but was born in the UK

* I've got a thing for travel

* I'm a closet comic book geek

* (hopefully) If I'm not on my computer, I'm probably at a coffeeshop or the gym
