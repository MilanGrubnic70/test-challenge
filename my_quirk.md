#### MY QUIRKS
	I love small objects and things--everything except Hello Kitty.
	I detest that f$#*ing pink adomination.

	I have a pet monkey named George.  George is an aspiring actor from the Amazon.  Not the forrest, but the warehouse.  I like to talk to George when my girlfriend is giving me a hard time.  You can see his debut in her film here: http://goo.gl/gNrm0l

	When I feel like an insomniac at 3am, I youtube philosophy lectures--particularly from John Searle or anything on Foucault--and some dry old white dude on Yale's Literary Criticism course.I understand half of what they say--which means I am doing deconstruction justice every time.

	I believe I have an addiction to tearing up laptops.  I would find excuses to take it apart--the logic board, top case, fan, memory--everything.
